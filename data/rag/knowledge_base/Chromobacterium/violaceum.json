  "clinical_significance": "The most clinically significant Chromobacterium species. Causes severe, often fatal infections including necrotizing skin infection, pneumonia, bacteremia, liver abscesses, and septic shock. Infection typically follows contamination of wounds with stagnant or tropical freshwater. Mortality is high without rapid intervention.",
  "phenotype_profile": {
    "morphology": "Gram-negative motile rods; occasional polar flagella.",
    "culture": "Produces distinctive deep violet pigment (violacein). Non-hemolytic or weakly hemolytic. Grows on blood, MacConkey, and nutrient agar.",
    "biochemical": [
      "Oxidase positive",
      "Catalase positive",
      "Indole negative",
      "ONPG negative",
      "Nitrate reduction positive",

      "Violacein pigment strongly identifies C. violaceum (absent in C. haemolyticum and most others).",

      "More commonly associated with abscess formation."

    "from other genera": [
