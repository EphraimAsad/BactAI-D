    "short": "Thermoactinomyces are thermophilic, Gram-positive, aerobic bacteria with filamentous/coryneform habit that appear as rods under simplified schemas; colonies are typically dry and powdery, and many species form heat-resistant spores.",
    "clinical_context": "Occasionally recovered from environmental exposures (compost, hay, dust). Classical association with hypersensitivity pneumonitis in agricultural settings; human invasive disease is rare."
